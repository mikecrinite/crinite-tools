Various scripts and things that don't really deserve their own repo

- Pinger.py: A tool I wrote to learn Python. Its purpose was to ping a network device to see if it was up, and if not, send an email as long as it was down. Before I could finish it, I got too busy with more important things, and so it doesn't work properly. It's not nearly as robust as the million other programs that do the same thing anyway.
- Scraper.py: A script that retrieves the first two columns in the 3 wikipedia pages which list over 1400 named colors and their hex codes
