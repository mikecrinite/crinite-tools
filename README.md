Various scripts and things that don't really deserve their own repo

- Pinger.py: A tool I wrote to learn Python. Its purpose is to ping a network device to see if it is up, and if not, send an email as long as it is down.
- Scraper.py: A script that retrieves the first two columns in the 3 wikipedia pages which list over 1400 named colors and their hex codes
- merge.py: Takes filename input for two images, combines them together. This looks better with larger images. There is a native merge function in PIL but it doesn't allow for fancy patterns to be created. Maybe eventually I'll switch up which pixels from which images get added and make a nice lattice or something interesting.
- Choice\_Scraper.py: Not much, just a quick little thing to learn about pandas. Would have been helpful if Choice Inline used tables instead of just pretty divs, but maybe I'll stick this in Scraper.py or whatever
